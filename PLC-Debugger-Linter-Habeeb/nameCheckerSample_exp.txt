High-Level Explanation of the Logic
Snake Case Naming Convention Checking
Objective: Ensure that names (variables, functions) follow the snake_case convention, commonly used in Python, and flag names that use camelCase or other conventions.

Logic:

Visitor (NameConventionVisitor): Traverses the AST to collect all names in the program, including variables and function names.
Each name is evaluated using regular expressions to identify if it follows snake_case or camelCase.
Names are then categorized into sets: snake_case_names, camel_case_names, and other_case_names.
Checker (NameConventionChecker): Takes the sets of names from NameConventionVisitor and checks for violations:
Any names in the camel_case_names or other_case_names sets are flagged as violations.
Violations are stored in a set with descriptive messages indicating the specific convention that was violated (e.g., "expected snake_case").
Result: The NameConventionChecker outputs a list of naming violations, identifying each name that doesnâ€™t follow snake_case.
